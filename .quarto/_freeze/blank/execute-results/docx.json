Progressively more specific paragraphs that culminate in a clear exposition of what is lacking in the literature. The introduction should not contain a broad literature review beyond the motivation of the paper.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe last paragraph compactly summarizes the results, which fill the gap just established and only briefly previews the conclusion of the paper, if at all.\n\n# Methods {#sec-methods}\n\n# Results {#sec-res}\n\nThe first results paragraph is special in that it typically summarizes the overall approach to the problem outlined in the introduction, along with any key innovative methods that were developed.\n\n# Discussion {#sec-discussion}\n\nExplain how the results have filled the gap that was identified in the introduction. Describe how the paper advances the field by providing new opportunities.\n\n# Funding\n\nGive the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# References {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Tables {#sec-tabs}\n\n# Figures {#sec-figs}\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Supplemental material {#sec-sm}\n\n## Supplemental tables\n\n## Supplemental figures\n",

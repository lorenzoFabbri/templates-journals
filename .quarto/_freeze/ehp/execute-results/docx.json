Place citation numbers outside periods and commas but inside colons and semicolons.\n\n# Introduction {#sec-intro}\n\n## Background\n\nExplain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being reported. Progressively more specific paragraphs that culminate in a clear exposition of what is lacking in the literature. The introduction should not contain a broad literature review beyond the motivation of the paper.\n\n## Objectives\n\nState specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses. The last paragraph compactly summarizes the results, which fill the gap just established and only briefly previews the conclusion of the paper, if at all.\n\n# Methods {#sec-methods}\n\n## Study design\n\n## Setting\n\nDescribe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection.\n\n## Participants\n\nGive the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of follow-up.\n\n## Variables\n\nClearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable.\n\n## Data sources\n\nFor each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement).\n\n## Bias\n\nDescribe any efforts to address potential sources of bias.\n\n## Study size\n\nExplain how the study size was arrived at.\n\n## Quantitative variables\n\nExplain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses.\n\n## Statistical methods\n\nDescribe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding. Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions. Explain how missing data were addressed. If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed. Describe any sensitivity analyses.\n\n# Results {#sec-res}\n\nThe first results paragraph is special in that it typically summarizes the overall approach to the problem outlined in the introduction, along with any key innovative methods that were developed.\n\n## Participants\n\nReport numbers of individuals at each stage of study--eg, numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed. Give reasons for non-participation at each stage. Consider use of a flow diagram.\n\n## Descriptive data\n\nGive characteristics of study participants (eg, demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders. Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest. Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total amount).\n\n## Outcome data\n\nReport numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time.\n\n## Main results\n\nGive unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included. Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized. If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period.\n\n## Other analyses\n\nReport other analyses done--eg, analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses.\n\n# Discussion {#sec-discussion}\n\n## Key results\n\nSummarise key results with reference to study objectives. Explain how the results have filled the gap that was identified in the introduction. Describe how the paper advances the field by providing new opportunities.\n\n## Strenghts and limitations\n\nDiscuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nGive a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.\n\n## Generalisability\n\nDiscuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study result.\n\n# Funding\n\nGive the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# References {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Tables {#sec-tabs}\n\n- One table per page.\n\n# Figures {#sec-figs}\n\n- Maximum width of 7.5 inches.\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Supplemental material {#sec-sm}\n\n## Supplemental tables\n\n- One table per page.\n\n## Supplemental figures\n\n- Maximum width of 7.5 inches.\n",
